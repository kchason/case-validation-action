## Overview
A GitHub Action validator for the CASE Cyber Ontology which is available at [https://caseontology.org/](https://caseontology.org/).

This is based on the `case_validate` library included in the CASE Utilities project available at: [https://github.com/casework/CASE-Utilities-Python](https://github.com/casework/CASE-Utilities-Python). 

This is also available as a Docker image at: [https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/kchason/case-validator](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/kchason/case-validator)

## GitHub Action Usage
Include the validation action in your GitHub action workflow and specify the file or directory to be validated.

```yaml
# Run the CASE validation job to confirm the output is valid
- name: CASE Export Validation
  uses: kchason/case-validation-action@v2.4
  with:
    case-path: ./output/
    case-version: "case-1.0.0"
    extension-filter: "jsonld"
	report-in-pr: true
```

## Docker Usage

Alternatively, the Docker image can be pulled from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/kchason/case-validator) and run locally or as part of custom integrations.

The environment variables are defined below in the "Inputs" table, and the below command is an example that can be modified to fit custom use cases.

```bash
# To run the latest image and remove the container after execution. 
docker run --rm \
	-e CASE_PATH="/opt/case/" \
	-e CASE_VERSION="case-1.0.0" \
	-e FILTER_EXTENSION="jsonld" \
	-v "/path/to/local:/opt/case" \
	kchason/case-validator:latest
```
